## Design

### Colour Scheme
My colour scheme consists of three colours which i feel work well and contrast each other nicely. 
I am using #0d2033 which is a dark blue as the main colour of the header and footer.
Then for the text, social links and headings i am using a mix of #e9ab00 and #dfdfdf.
Both of these stand out well against the blue and i feel all compliment eachother. 

### Typography
I plan to use "Ubuntu" as the main font type for my website. I may use the "ubuntu monospace" variant
to help some text areas stand apart from others.
