## Design

### Colour Scheme
My colour scheme consists of three colours which i feel work well and contrast each other nicely. 
I am using #0d2033 which is a dark blue as the main colour of the header and footer.
Then for the text, social links and headings i am using a mix of #e9ab00 and #dfdfdf.
Both of these stand out well against the blue and i feel all compliment eachother. 

### Typography
I plan to use "Ubuntu" as the main font type for my website. I may use the "ubuntu monospace" variant
to help some text areas stand apart from others.

### Updates i made to my wireframes;
After starting on the design of my site there were some things i realised wouldn't work as well in practice. 
Therefore i changed my proects section so that my cards sat above and below each other rather than side by side
on smaller screens.

##Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

#### First Time Visitor goals;
 As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to understand the purpose of the site and what the company does.

  - On the first visit to the site, the user is greeted with a large hero image of numerous sporting types and a callout which strongly 
 suggests the main purpose of the site is to upload content. This includes a large button which directly links to the upload page.

  - This large hero image is followed by testimonials which highlight further the sites purpose and benefits. 

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate around the site seamlessly.
  a. All navigation links work. While the active link is highlighted letting the user know exactly which page they are currently on. 
 
As a first time user I want to be able to see working partners of the site.
  - Within the about us section the working partners are clearly highlighted towards the bottom of the page. They all fit 
  neatly within an images carousel which means they are easy to digest and can be easily navigated.  

As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see past users experiences with the company to see if they do what they say.
 I also want easy access to their social media accounts such as instagram, youtube etc.
   - On the home page testimonials highlight successful user experiences.
   - Social media links are at the center of the footer on every page and stand out clearly against the footer.

#### Returning Visitor Goals;
As a returning visitor I'm ready to upload the content I have created and want a clear path to be able to do this.
  - The "upload now" callout button is clear and stands out on the homepage.
  - Upload is also a clear option in the navigation bar. 

As a returning visitor I want to know that my material has been successfully submitted.
  - Upon successful upload of material, user is presented with a message confirming that their material was succesfully uploaded.

As a returning visitor I want to know i will receive some feedback on my submission.
  - Succesful upload message confirms that Tekker tracker will be in touch regarding upload.

#### Frequent  Visitor Goals
As a frequent user i would have received feedback on previous submissions and be looking to submit more or improved content.
  - I now have a good understanding of the website and I can easily navigate to the upload section either by the "upload now" 
  callout button or via the upload link in the neavigation bar.

As a frequent user i would want to see up to date and current projects. Including what the company is currently doing.
 - The projects section highlights work that the company has undertaken as well as suggesting checking out social links for more.

As a frequent user i would want contact details to chase up my submission if i hadn't heard back.
  - contact details are clear and on the footer of every page.
