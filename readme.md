## Design

- Colour Scheme
  - The colour scheme consists of four main colours which work well and contrast each other nicely; 
    - Using #0d2033 which is a dark blue as the main colour of the header and footer.
    - For the text, social links and headings i am using a mix of #e9ab00 and #dfdfdf.
Both of these stand out well against the blue and they all compliment eachother.
    - #a0a0a0 is used as a general background colour across all pages.  

- Typography
  - "Ubuntu" is used as the main font type for the website, as well as using the "ubuntu monospace" variant
for the placeholder text inside form groupa. 
For the testimonials section "permanent marker" font type was used to highlight the fact they are quotes and help them really stand out.  

- Imagery
  - Imagery is vital in this project. The large animated background image shows that a variety of sports are covered.
  While it is also eyecatching, it makes the site stand out and feel interactive.   

## Wireframes

Large screens original - [View](assets/wireframes/ms1-large-original.pdf)

### Updates made to the wireframes;
After starting on the design of the site there were some things that didn't work as well in practice; 
- Changed the proects section so that the cards sat above and below each other rather than side by side
on smaller screens.
- Added in a "contact-us" section as found when testing user experiences that only having some limited contact information in the footer
wasn't really clear enough.
- moved videos below the images carousel, as they can take longer to load in.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
#### First Time Visitor goals;
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to understand the purpose of the site and what the company does.

  1. On the first visit to the site, the user is greeted with a large hero image of numerous sporting types and a callout which strongly 
 suggests the main purpose of the site is to upload content. This includes a large button which directly links to the upload page.

  1. This large hero image is followed by testimonials which highlight further the sites purpose and benefits. 

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate around the site seamlessly.
  1. All navigation links work. While the active link is highlighted letting the user know exactly which page they are currently on. 
 
- As a first time user I want to be able to see working partners of the site.
  1. Within the about us section the working partners are clearly highlighted towards the bottom of the page. They all fit 
  neatly within an images carousel which means they are easy to digest and can be easily navigated.  

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see past users experiences with the company to see if they do what they say.
 I also want easy access to their social media accounts such as instagram, youtube etc.
   1. On the home page testimonials highlight successful user experiences.
   1. Social media links are at the center of the footer on every page and stand out clearly against the footer.
   1. Within the about-us section there are larger social media links and more than could be fitted inside the footer comfortably.

  1. The "upload now" callout button is clear and stands out on the homepage.
  1. Upload is also a clear option in the navigation bar. 

- As a returning user i would want to see up to date and current projects. Including what the company is currently doing.
1. The "gallery" section highlights work that the company has undertaken as well as suggesting checking out social links for more. 

#### Frequent  Visitor Goals
- As a frequent user i would be looking to submit more or improved content.
  1. I now have a good understanding of the website and I can easily navigate to the upload section either by the "upload now" 
  callout button or via the upload link in the navigation bar.

- As a frequent user i would want contact details to chase up my submission if i hadn't heard back.
  1. contact email is clear and on the footer of every page.
  1. A contact us section is included on the about-us page which is easy to read and includes all relevant contact information.
